General Information
------- -----------

EtherApe is a network traffic browser. It displays network activity
graphically. It uses GNOME libraries as it's user interface, and 
libpcap, a packet capture and filtering library.

EtherApe started as an etherman clone, but now it has some unique
features. It can run in "interape" mode with -m ip, and in
"tcp-ape" mode with -m tcp. Expect more modes to come soon.

EtherApe will use /etc/ethers if there is one. If not, it will 
try to reverse lookup the ip address. 

IMPORTANT! It is particularly important when running EtherApe
to have the ethernet address of your router in /etc/ethers.
If not, your router will have as name whatever IP address
it was forwarding traffic from when it was first heard.

Check the NEWS file for the latest developments, and 
etherape --help for the current set of options.

You will have to have superuser privileges in order to use this
program, as is the case with any libpcap based application.

If you are not running on a high-color or better display, you
might want to use the --no-fade option.

Note: EtherApe is being _actively_ developed: I tend to release
daily. If you liked the program, I suggest you take a look at
the webpage and look for the latest version.


Installation:
-------------
Please read the INSTALL file for installation instructions.
Brief summary:

        # ./configure
        # make install

By default, binaries will be copied to /usr/local/sbin
You may uninstall later by running

	# make uninstall

You will also find information on how to build a debian package
in the INSTALL file.


Porting:
--------
EtherApe has been compiled in at least:
* Linux: Debian 2.2, Slackware 4.0 and 7.0, RedHat 6.1,
  modified linuxppc 1999, Debian m68k
* NetBSD 1.4T (i386)

EtherApe should probably compile and run in other Unix-like OS. If
you manage to compile it in a configuration other than the ones
