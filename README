General Information
------- -----------

Etherape is a network traffic browser. It displays network activity
graphically. It uses GNOME libraries as it's user interface, and 
libpcap, a packet capture and filtering library.

Etherape started as an etherman clone, but now it has some unique
features. It can run in "interape" mode with -m ip, and in
"tcp-ape" mode with -m tcp. Expect more modes to come soon.

(Note that -I is gone. Use -m ip)

Etherape will use /etc/ethers if there is one. If not, it will 
display dotted quad ip addresses. You can even ask for ip
name resolution with the -r option, but beware of very long
DNS timeout times.

IMPORTANT! It is particularly important when running etherape
to have the ethernet address of your router in /etc/ethers.
If not, your router will have as name whatever IP address
it was forwarding traffic from when it was first heard.

You will have to have superuser privileges in order to use this
program, as is the case with any libpcap based application.

Installation:
-------------
Please read the INSTALL file for installation instructions.
Brief summary:

        # ./configure
        # make install

By default, binaries will be copied to /usr/local/sbin
You may uninstall later by running

	# make uninstall


Porting:
--------
Etherape has been compiled in at least:
* Linux: Debian 2.2, Slackware 4.0 and 7.0, RedHat 6.1
* NetBSD 1.4T (i386)
* Sparc Solaris 7 with gcc 2.95.2

I still haven't figured how they ethereal developers managed,
but a user suggests compiling your own version of libpcap to 
solve your problems. If you are an RedHat 6.1 user, keep an 
eye on
http://sourceforge.net/bugs/?func=detailbug&bug_id=102377&group_id=2712

Etherape should probably compile and run in other Unix-like OS. If
you manage to compile it in a configuration other than the ones
listed, please post it to the mailing list
<etherape-users@lists.sourceforge.net> No need to subscribe.

To post a message, mail to 'etherape-users@lists.sourceforge.net'
Be advised that emails sent to me will always be replied cc'ed
to the list, as an attempt to minimise the number of times I have
to answer a question. Being so you might as well write to the
list directly. :-)

To receive a message whenever a new version of Etherape is 
available, go to http://sourceforge.net/project/?group_id=2712 and
click on the "Monitor this module" link.

Bug reports and feature requests should be sent in order 
of preference:
* The bug tracking system, http://sourceforge.net/bugs/?group_id=2712
* The mailing list, etherape-users@lists.sourceforge.net
* The author himself.

Even though I'd ask you to post your bug report or feature 
request on the bug tracking system, it would be nice if you could
drop a note on the mailing list as well to say that you did so.

You might want to have a look at 
http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html
before reporting your bug. It makes an interesting reading.
But if you will only do one thing, I prefer receiving your
bug than you reading the article! :-)

If you already are a sourceforge user, please take the time to 
tell me what would be your favourite next feature filling the 
anonymous survey at 
http://sourceforge.net/survey/survey.php?group_id=2712&survey_id=10248

If not, you could always answer the same questions on the
mailing list.
