General Information
------- -----------

Etherape is a network traffic browser. It displays network activity
graphically. It uses GNOME libraries as it's user interface, and 
libpcap, a packet capture and filtering library.

It should compile on a linux machine with the proper developping
environment, and maybe even on other Unix operating systems.
I have yet to receive a single failed compilation report on any
machine, but that may probably be because I have not yet received
any kind of compilation success report. :-) (Hint!)

You will have to have superuser privileges in order to use this
program, as is the case with any libpcap based application.
