General Information
------- -----------

Etherape is a network traffic browser. It displays network activity
graphically. It uses GNOME libraries as it's user interface, and 
libpcap, a packet capture and filtering library.

You will have to have superuser privileges in order to use this
program, as is the case with any libpcap based application.

Etherape will use /etc/ethers if there is one. If not, it will 
display dotted quad ip addresses. You can even ask for ip
name resolution with the -r option, but beware of very long
DNS timeout times.

Etherape has been compiled in at least:
* Linux: Debian 2.2, RedHat 6.1, Slackware 7.0
* NetBSD 1.4T (i386)

It should probably compile and run in other unix-like OS. If
you manage to compile it in a configuration other than the ones
listed, please post it to the mailing list
<etherape-users@lists.sourceforge.net> No need to subscribe.

Even though I'd ask you to post your bug report or feature 
request on the bug tracking system, it would be nice if you could
drop a note on the mailing list as well to say that you did so.
