General Information
------- -----------

Etherape is a network traffic browser. It displays network activity
graphically. It uses GNOME libraries as it's user interface, and 
libpcap, a packet capture and filtering library.

It should compile on a linux machine with the proper developping
environment, and maybe even on other Unix operating systems.

You will have to have superuser privileges in order to use this
program, as is the case with any libpcap based application.

I've tried my best to find any other program that provides similar
functionality as this (other than the real etherman, that is) to no
avail. If you happen to know any such program, please let me now.
Am I by chance wasting my time?

If you want to see node names instead of hardware addresses, 
use the /etc/ethers file. From the ethers man page:

	/etc/ethers  contains  48 bit Ethernet addresses and their
	corresponding IP numbers, one line for each IP number:
	
	Ethernet-address  IP-number
	
	The two items are separated by any number of
	SPACE  and/or
	TAB char acters.   A # at the beginning of a line starts a
	comment which extends to the end of the line.  The  Ether­
	net-address  is  written as x:x:x:x:x:x, where x is a hex­
	adecimal number between 0 and ff which
	represents one byte
	of  the  address,  which  is  in  network byte order (big-
	endian).  The IP-number may be a  hostname  which  can  be
	resolved by DNS or a dot separated number.
