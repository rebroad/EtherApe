General Information
------- -----------

Etherape is a network traffic browser. It displays network activity
graphically. It uses GNOME libraries as it's user interface, and 
libpcap, a packet capture and filtering library.

It should compile on a linux machine with the proper developping
environment, and maybe even on other Unix operating systems.
There's been a report of successful compilation on NetBSD,
but right now you have to change the name of the capturing
device, hardcoded in capture.c.

You will have to have superuser privileges in order to use this
program, as is the case with any libpcap based application.

I've tried my best to find any other program that provides similar
functionality as this (other than the real etherman, that is) to no
avail. If you happen to know any such program, please let me now.
Am I by chance wasting my time?

It will use /etc/ethers if there is one. If not, it will 
display dotted quad ip address. You can even ask for ip
name resolution with the -r option, but beware of very long
DNS timeout times.
