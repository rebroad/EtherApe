General Information
------- -----------

Etherape is a network traffic browser. It displays network activity
graphically. It uses GNOME libraries as it's user interface, and 
libpcap, a packet capture and filtering library.

It should compile on a linux machine with the proper developping
environment, and maybe even on other Unix operating systems.
I have yet to receive a single failed compilation report on any
machine, but that may probably be because I have not yet received
any kind of compilation success report. :-) (Hint!)

You will have to have superuser privileges in order to use this
program, as is the case with any libpcap based application.

I've tried my best to find any other program that provides similar
functionality as this (other than the real etherman, that is) to no
avail. If you happen to know any such program, please let me now.
Am I by chance wasting my time?
