    <para>

    <application>EtherApe</application> is a graphical network monitor
      for Unix modeled after etherman. Featuring ether, ip and tcp
      modes, it displays network activity graphically. Hosts and links
      change in size with traffic. Protocols are color coded. It
      supports ethernet, fddi, ppp and slip devices. It can filter
      traffic to be shown, and can read traffic from a file as well as
      live from the network.
    </para>
    
    <para>
      <application>EtherApe</application> is also a tool for gathering
      network statistics, and the data can be presented in a number of
      different ways.

 <!-- ================ Usage ================================ -->
 <!-- This section should describe basic usage of the application. -->

  <sect1 id="usage">
    <title>Using EtherApe</title>
    <para>
      <application>EtherApe</application> can be used to have an
      overview of traffic conditions in your network. It is a great
      tool to easily pinpoint who is consuming the most bandwith, or
      to check which computers are actually talking to some others.
    </para>

    <!-- ========= Basic Usage =========================== -->
    <sect2 id="quickstart">
      <title>Quick Start</title>
      <para>Most of the time you will want to run
	<application>EtherApe</application> with root permissions in
	order to monitor a live network. If you are not the
	administrator of the machine running
	<application>EtherApe</application> , you will ony be able to
	analyze previously generated capture files, generated by
	someone else.</para>
      <para>
        Starting <application>EtherApe</application> opens the
	<interface>Main window</interface>, shown in <xref
        linkend="mainwindow-fig">. <!-- ==== Figure ==== -->
        <figure id="mainwindow-fig">
	  <title>EtherApe Main Window</title>
	  <screenshot>
		  <screeninfo>EtherApe Main Window</screeninfo>
		  <graphic fileref="../../etherape.png" >
	  </screenshot>
	</figure> <!-- ==== End of Figure ==== -->
      </para> 

      <para>By default, <application>EtherApe</application> will try
	to open the default network interface for capture in IP mode,
	and will display a diagram of network traffic right
	away.</para>
      <para>Every computer currently taking part in a conversation in
	the network will be represented as a circle (a node) in the
	diagram, with its name displayed on top of it. The fact that
	two computers are communicating with each other is represented
	with a line between those two nodes (a link).</para>
      <para>You will notice that both nodes and links vary with time
	in color and size. Size is used to represent the amount of
	traffic: The bigger a node is, the more traffic it is dumping
	into the network. The wider a link is, the more data is
	flowing in that particular between those two nodes.</para>
      <para>Color, on the other hand, is used to represent the
	protocol being used the most by a link or a node. You will
	find a legend for what a particular color means in the left
	side of the <interface>main window</interface>.</para>
      <para>Look closely and you will notice that in fact links are
	not lines between nodes. Rather, every direction of
	communication is represented by a triangle. Packets go from
	the shorter side to the opposite vertex. Since computers
	usally talk back, there will usually be two such triangles
	between two nodes, the base of each representing how much each
	node is contributing to the conversation.
      </para>
      <para>You don't need to know much more if you just want to have
	a simple look at your network. Nevertheless, there are many
	settings that you can use to configure what exactly will
	appear in the diagram, and you will have to understand how
	this settings affect the program to have a proper
	comprehension of the meaning of the display.
      </para>
      <para>Besides, EtherApe offers you the possibility of displaying
	stastistics for many of the elements involved. Read on to
	learn how.</para>
