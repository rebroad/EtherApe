In order to compile from CVS you will need additional development tools.
Using previous or later versions may or may not work.

autoconf, version 2.53
automake, version 1.4
gettext, version 0.11.5

To compile, first run 

./autogen.sh

and ignore messages regarding aclocal and gettext.h. Then you may build the package using

make

Good luck! ;-)

Juan.
