 Etherape Code Overview
 ======================
 Current as of 0.4.2

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Here I'll try to explain the workings of etherape, both for new
contributors to have a clearer view of the program and for self
future reference.

-----------------

src/main.c
	Parses command line options. Calls initialization
	functions of capture and diagram. Loads and saves
	configuration. Handles gnome session management.
	
src/capture.c
	Reads packets from the network and keeps track of
	information gathered.

src/protocols.c
	Functions used to find the protocol stack of a given
	packet.

src/dns.c
	Asynchronously reverse lookup of ip addresses.
	
src/resolv.c
	Several helper functions, mostly to look up the ethernet
	address in /etc/ethers

src/diagram.c
	Updates the diagram, which is a gnome_canvas widget.
	Takes care of appbar information and node pop-ups.

src/callbacks.c
	Handles GUI interaction. Buttons clicked, adjustments
	changed, etc.
	
src/interface.c
	GUI creation. Automatically created by glade from
	etherape.glade.
	
src/util.c and src/support.c
	helper functions provided by glade.


1. Basic Architecture
---------------------

   Etherape is running on a gtk_look started in main(). There are
two callbacks functions active that execute code. One is a
timeout set each refresh_period to update the diagram on the
screen, update_diagram, and the other is a gdk_input called each
time there is a new packet available in the network, packet_read.

   I try to clearly separate code and data structures of data
gathering and presentation. Data gathering is performed in
capture.c and
