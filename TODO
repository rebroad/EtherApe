User visible features:
----------------------

  * Extend the protocols known further than just IP.
  
  * Make protocol colors user-selectable.
  
  * Ability to set per node preferences. Like setting an hour long
    averaging time only for the router.
    
  * Ability to manually place nodes. It's dependent on the above.
    Once is done you will be able to open and save your own 
    diagrams.

Issues in the source code
-------------------------
 
  * I've come to the conclusion that names should be acquired
    at packet analyzing stage (probably an option), so that
    we keep a single per packet offset that is incremented
    as each protocol is analyzed.

  * Use a GArray instead of a fixed array for the protocols
    stack.

  * change all those ugly while (i+1) in capture.c

  * Find out a way to customize the gnome message that pops up
    if a SIGSEGV crashes us.
    
  * Clean up the resolver functions. Right now I'm using two 
    different files from two different packages (resolv.c from 
    ethereal and dns.c from mtr)

  * belongs_to should be a packet property, and not have to be
    passed from the functions.
  
  * Add incoming and outcoming traffic into a single canvas_link,
    and not put them one underneath the other. Funny no one has
    noticed. :-)

  * Only now I realize that I could just use a regular
    GtkTooltips for the canvas tooltips and not create my own.
