User visible features:
----------------------

  * Ability to set per node preferences. Like setting an hour long
    averaging time only for the router.

  * Ability to manually place nodes. It's dependent on the above.
    Once is done you will be able to open and save your own 
    diagrams.

  * Hitting cancel on the preferences window should undo all
    changes done.

Issues in the source code
-------------------------

  * Generalize a way to return error messages from capture.c
  
  * Stablish criteria for the meaning of a function's gboolean 
    return value. Does it mean it was correct or there was an
    error? There are examples of opposite cases.
  
  * Why am I using a global "interface" and a second "device"
    in capture.c? Check that I can just use interface.

  * Use a GArray instead of a fixed array for the protocols
    stack.

  * change all those ugly while (i+1) in capture.c

  * Find out a way to customize the gnome message that pops up
    if a SIGSEGV crashes us.

  * Define GLADEDIR in config.h the same way that PIXMAPS_DIR is, and not
    just pass it to the compiler
