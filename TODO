* Clean up the resolver functions. Right now I'm using two different
  files from two different packages (resolv.c from ethereal and
  dns.c from mtr)

* belongs_to should be a packet property, and not have to be
  passed from the functions.
  
* Add incoming and outcoming traffic into a single canvas_link,
  and not put them one underneath the other. Funny no one has
  noticed. :-)
