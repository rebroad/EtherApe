<HTML><title>Changelog for Etherape</title><BODY>
<h3>Overview of changes in CVS Etherape 0.1.7 (Tuesday 02-28-2000):</h3><ul>
<li>Pcap filtering added. Now you can use tcpdump style filtering 
(enclosed in quotes) with the -f option.
<li>Added libm to autoconf.in for systems with a separate math lib.
<li>First try at debian packaging.
</ul>
<h3>Overview of changes in Etherape 0.1.6 (Monday 02-28-2000):</h3><ul>
<li>Refresh period spin, averaging time spin, and link width sliders
    now work. Time to get better than Quake framerates! :-)
<li>Node, link and text colors can be set from the command line.
<li>The rest of the GUI is active, so that it can answer itself
    people's favorite question. :-) (Well, Control-Q does actually work!)
<li>Automated release process so that I can keep bombarding
    you with releases.
</ul>
<h3>Overview of changes in Etherape 0.1.5 (Sunday 02-27-2000):</h3><ul>
<li> More for readability: Click on a node and a pop-up window
  appears with all node data.
<li> You can change the network interface to listen to in the 
  command line.
<li> Fixed a bug in the dotted quad ip number display
<li> Compiles without warnings
<li> Updated README

</ul><h3>Overview of changes in Etherape 0.1.4 (Sunday 02-27-2000):</h3><ul>
<li> Now parses command line arguments:
  <br>etherape options
  <br>-n, --numeric               don't convert addresses to names
  <br>-r, --with-dns-resolving    use IP name resolving. Caution! Long timeouts!
  <br>-d, --diagram-only          don't display any node text identification
<li> The resolver is turned off by default since it can potentially
  freeze your display for too long
<li> digram-only makes for a clearer display. It's intended to be
  practical whenenver I have per-node pop-up windows ready.

</ul><h3>Overview of changes in Etherape 0.1.3 (Saturday 02-26-2000):</h3><ul>
<li> Links with no traffic disappear with time. Makes diagram
  more readable.
<li> IP host name displayed if no ether name available
<li> Oops! Was confusing ether dst and src addresses. Solved.
<li> Webpage now has a much more interesting screenshot thanks 
  to Nico Lumma 
<li> Buttons are in English now.
<li>(This file I had to get out from download because it
had the dangerous DNS behaviour by default. You see? That's
what happens when you are rushed by deadlines! :-) )

</ul><h3>Overview of changes in Etherape 0.1.2 (Saturday 02-26-2000):</h3><ul>
<li> James Wallace provided code to automatically
  detect proper network interface. It now compiles in NetBSD.
<li> IP number displayed if no /etc/ethers is available.
  IP host name will be there in the Saturday Night edition. :-)

  version upgrade. :-)
  
</ul><h3>Overview of changes in Etherape 0.0.8 (Thursday 02-24-2000):</h3><ul>
<li> Correctly (I hope) calculates average traffic intensity
  for nodes and links. The proper constant multiplier
