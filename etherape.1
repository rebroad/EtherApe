.SH FILES
Etherape will use

if there is one. If not, it will
try to reverse lookup the ip address.

.B IMPORTANT!
It is particularly important when running in ethernet mode
to have the ethernet address of your router in  /etc/ethers.
If not, your router will have as name whatever IP address
it was forwarding traffic from when it was first heard.
