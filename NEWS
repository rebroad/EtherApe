  Overview of changes in Etherape 0.3.3 (Thursday 03-23-2000):
  
     * Fixes a serious and stupid segfault.
     * Recognizes level 4 IP protocols (set stack level to 4)
       
  Overview of changes in Etherape 0.3.2 (Wednesday 03-22-2000):
  
     * You may choose what level of the protocol stack to look at. Now I
       should be able to add more protocol decoding easyly.
     * I think I have squashed the growing legend bug. Please report.
     * Diagram tries to use most of the window.
     * Got away with some other memory leaks, though I probably just
       introduced some others.
       
  Overview of changes in Etherape 0.3.1 (Monday 03-20-2000):
  
     * Capture filter may be set in the preferences dialog in runtime
     * Warning! The above is just candy to have you all test some major
       code restructuring. Please report any problems.
       
  Overview of changes in Etherape 0.3.0 (Saturday 03-18-2000):
  
     * Preferences can be saved
     * The status bar shows the main protocol when over a link, and the
       node name when over a node.
     * Etherape turns 1 month old! Thanks everybody for using this
       software. :-)
       
  Overview of changes in Etherape 0.2.11 (Friday 03-17-2000):
  
     * Fixed a segfault in linuxppc
     * Fixed a minor bug in the protocols legend
     * Translations to French and Spanish
       
  Overview of changes in Etherape 0.2.10 (Thursday 03-16-2000):
  
     * Fixed several memory leaks (it's still leaking, though :-( )
     * Added font picker to the diagram settings
     * Size mode menu is now working.
     * Should compile again in Solaris
       
  Overview of changes in Etherape 0.2.9 (Thursday 03-16-2000):
  
     * Fix for bug introduced in 0.2.8. Resetting the refresh rate
       eventually broght a SIGSEGV.
       
  Overview of changes in Etherape 0.2.8 (Wednesday 03-15-2000):
  
     * GUI enhancements suggested by mdf to save screen real state.
          + Diagram settings is a dialog under the preferences menu
          + Legend becomes a dockable item
          + Toolbar, legend and appbar may be hidden using the view menu.
     * GUI for two more sizing algorithms: log and sqrt. I'm afraid I
       still don't know how to get the menu item from an option_menu,
       though. Patch, anyone? :-)
       
  Overview of changes in Etherape 0.2.7 (Monday 03-13-2000):
  
     * Node info is now a popup.
     * Popup window shows Name, IP address and MAC address again.
     * Name is only FQDN in ip and tcp modes (more readable)
     * Now links age the moment they are not used.

     * Fix for sigsegv when small link timeouts.
       
  Overview of changes in Etherape 0.2.6 (Saturday 03-11-2000):
  
     * Ethernet protocols are recognized and presented in different
       colors.
     * Links not in use are slowly faded out (patch by Ted Wright). Use
       --no-fade to avoid it.
     * Finally found a way to set the diagram background to black.
       
  Overview of changes in Etherape 0.2.5 (Friday 03-10-2000):
  
     * Initial support for color coded protocols display
     * Click on a link and a get a debug message with the most common
       ethernet protocol
     * Released to test for bugs some major changes in the code. Go for
       0.2.4 if you want some guarantee of a more stable version.
       
  Overview of changes in Etherape 0.2.4 (Thursday 03-09-2000):
  
     * Major bug fix.
     * Added README.bugs with procedures for bug reporting.
       
  Overview of changes in Etherape 0.2.3 (Wednesday 03-08-2000):
  
     * Non blocking reverse lookups. I brought dns.c in from mtr to
       provide this functionality. This code is from Simon Kirby.
     * Removed now unnecessary -r option.
       
  Overview of changes in Etherape 0.2.2 (Tuesday 03-07-2000):
  
     * Added ppp and slip devices support.
     * Brought back IP address display in ethernet mode when no
       /etc/ethers is available
     * Fixed another bug with RedHat 6.1. (I really have to find time to
       talk to this guy)
       
  Overview of changes in Etherape 0.2.1 (Monday 03-06-2000):
  
     * Added tcp mode. Run with etherape -m tcp
     * Added fix from Ted Wright to provide a more readable display in
       crowded diagrams. Run with -o. Very useful for tcp.
     * Cleaned up sources so that adding other modes should be trivial.
       Please have a look at the source.
       
  Overview of changes in Etherape 0.2.0 (Friday 03-03-2000):
  
     * RedHat 6.1 fix. Works around "featureful" redhat 6.1 libpcap.
     * Fixed node-in-the-center bug.
     * Timeout=0 means never timeout.
       
  Overview of changes in Etherape 0.1.9 (Thursday 03-02-2000):
  
     * Finally I'm properly calculating average traffic. (yeah, right :-)
     * Node and link timeout work as expected as well.
     * Should now compile cleanly in Solaris.
     * Interape is a hardlinked to etherape. Runs as interape when called
       with that name.
     * Minor changes to the naming algorithm.
       
  Overview of changes in Etherape 0.1.8 (Wednesday 03-01-2000):
  
     * First version of interape. Run as etherape -I. I guess I'll have
       to change the name to netape now. :-)
     * Added node and link timeouts controls.
       
  Overview of changes in Etherape 0.1.7 (Tuesday 02-29-2000):
  
     * Pcap filtering added. Now you can use tcpdump style filtering
       (enclosed in quotes) with the -f option.
     * Added libm to autoconf.in for systems with a separate math lib.
     * First try at Debian packaging.
       
  Overview of changes in Etherape 0.1.6 (Monday 02-28-2000):
  
     * Refresh period spin, averaging time spin, and link width sliders
       now work. Time to get better than Quake frame rates! :-)
     * Node, link and text colours can be set from the command line.
     * The rest of the GUI is active, so that it can answer itself
       people's favourite question. :-) (Well, Control-Q does actually
       work!)
     * Automated release process so that I can keep bombarding you with
       releases.
       
  Overview of changes in Etherape 0.1.5 (Sunday 02-27-2000):
  
     * More for readability: Click on a node and a pop-up window appears
       with all node data.
     * You can change the network interface to listen to in the command
       line.
     * Fixed a bug in the dotted quad ip number display
     * Compiles without warnings
     * Updated README
       
  Overview of changes in Etherape 0.1.4 (Sunday 02-27-2000):
  
     * Now parses command line arguments:
       etherape options
       -n, --numeric don't convert addresses to names
       -r, --with-dns-resolving use IP name resolving. Caution! Long
       timeouts!
       -d, --diagram-only don't display any node text identification
     * The resolver is turned off by default since it can potentially
       freeze your display for too long
     * digram-only makes for a clearer display. It's intended to be
       practical whenever I have per-node pop-up windows ready.
       
  Overview of changes in Etherape 0.1.3 (Saturday 02-26-2000):
  
     * Links with no traffic disappear with time. Makes diagram more
       readable.
     * IP host name displayed if no ether name available
     * Oops! Was confusing ether dst and src addresses. Solved.
     * Web page now has a much more interesting screenshot thanks to Nico
       Lumma
     * Buttons are in English now.
     * (This file I had to get out from download because it had the
       dangerous DNS behaviour by default. You see? That's what happens
       when you are rushed by deadlines! :-) )
       
  Overview of changes in Etherape 0.1.2 (Saturday 02-26-2000):
  
     * James Wallace provided code to automatically detect proper network
       interface. It now compiles in NetBSD.
     * IP number displayed if no /etc/ethers is available. IP host name
       will be there in the Saturday Night edition. :-)
       
  Overview of changes in Etherape 0.1.1 (Friday 02-25-2000):
  
     * First look at GUI side of things
     * Now you can dynamically reset the node radius using a slider
     * First users reports! Thanks R., Don!
     * First improvements due to user feedback:
          + Solved configuration problem for some people
          + Improved web page and README: reference to /etc/ethers
       
  Overview of changes in Etherape 0.1.0 (Friday 02-25-2000):
  
     * Diagram resizes with window
     * Basic functionality is all there now, and calls for a minor
       version upgrade. :-)
       
  Overview of changes in Etherape 0.0.8 (Thursday 02-24-2000):
  
     * Correctly (I hope) calculates average traffic intensity for nodes
       and links. The proper constant multiplier should be user defined.
       
  Overview of changes in Etherape 0.0.7 (Thursday 02-24-2000):
  
     * First version showing links among nodes
     * Aborts gracefully if run by non-root.
     * http://etherape.sourceforge.net has a screenshot.
     * Expect proper node size and link width calculation in 0.0.8
       
  Overview of changes in Etherape 0.0.6 (Wednesday 02-23-2000):
  
     * Copied proper libpcap autoconfigure detection function from
       ethereal
     * Added Ethernet address resolution functions from ethereal
       
  Overview of changes in Etherape 0.0.5 (Wednesday 02-23-2000):
  
     * Now uses gnome_canvas to display the diagram
       
  Overview of changes in Etherape 0.0.4 (Monday 02-21-2000):
  
     * Node size is now an average of the last ten seconds traffic.
     * Proper distribution file.
       
  Overview of changes in Etherape 0.0.3 (Sunday 02-20-2000):
  
     * Added gnome support.
     * Substituted hash table for binary tree to store nodes
     * Correctly display hardware addresses.
       
  Overview of changes in Etherape 0.0.2 (Saturday 02-19-2000):
  
     * Displays circles representing nodes and text which will identify
       it eventually.
       
  Overview of Etherape 0.0.1 (Friday 02-18-2000):
  
     * Initial version. Don't even expect it to run.
