  <title>EtherApe: Reporting Bugs</title>

<h2>Known bugs</h2>

  <p>For a list of known issues and bugs, point your browser to
  <a href=
  "http://sourceforge.net/bugs/?group_id=2712">http://sourceforge.net/bugs/?group_id=2712</a>

  <h2>How to report a bug</h2>

  <p>Having users is great, not only because it is the purpose of
  creating this program in the first place, but because they stress
  your program in many different ways and help you make it more
  robust.

  <p>If you do encounter a problem with this program, plase write a
  bug report at <a href=
  "http://sourceforge.net/bugs/?group_id=2712">http://sourceforge.net/bugs/?group_id=2712</a>

  <p>When you write your report, I'd be thankful if you could
  follow these guidelines, in order of importance.

  <ol>
    <li>Make sure that the most current version does have the bug.
    Not only does this mean to download the latest version, but
    also making sure that you are _running_ the latest version. Go
    to src and run as ./etherape

    <li>Things to include:

      <ul>
        <li>Operating system and distribution

        <li>EtherApe version (etherape --version, or check the
        about box)

        <li>pcap version (and package version as well)

        <li>gtk and gnome libs version (package version as well)

        <li>If possible, a backtrace (See below)

        <li>Please leave an email address or log in before posting
        your bug, so that I can later get in contact with you.
      </ul>

    <li>Read this link first <a href=
    "http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html">http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html</a>
    It is really informative, and it will be really useful not only
    for etherape.
  </ol>

  <p>Please understand that I _love_ to receive bug reports,
  because that means that I will be improving the program, but the
  more info you provide, the faster I'll be able to solve the
  problem.

  <h2>How to provide a backtrace</h2>

  <p>In cases in which etherape is crashing (not when it produces
  bad results), it is most useful if I can see what was the program
  doing when it crashed.

  <p>It is actually simple, you just need to type four
  instructions.
  <pre>

# export GNOME_DISABLE_CRASH_DIALOG=1
# gdb etherape
(gdb) run [options your were using]
(gdb) backtrace
</pre>

  <p>Here's an example of what it would look like. When you write
  your report, you only need to send me from the "Program received
  signal SIGSEGV" bit onwards.
  <pre>
