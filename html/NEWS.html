<h3>Overview of changes in Etherape 0.2.5 (Friday 03-10-2000):</h3><ul>
<li>Initial support for color coded protocols display
<li>Click on a link and a get a debug message with the most common
ethernet protocol

</ul>
<h3>Overview of changes in Etherape 0.2.4 (Thursday 03-09-2000):</h3><ul>
<li>Major bug fix.
<li>Added README.bugs with procedures for bug reporting.
</ul>
<h3>Overview of changes in Etherape 0.2.3 (Wednesday 03-08-2000):</h3><ul>
<li>Non blocking reverse lookups. I brought dns.c in from mtr to
provide this functionality. This code is from Simon Kirby.
<li>Removed now unnecessary -r option.
</ul>
<h3>Overview of changes in Etherape 0.2.2 (Tuesday 03-07-2000):</h3><ul>
<li>Added ppp and slip devices support.
<li>Brought back IP address display in ethernet mode when no /etc/ethers
is available
<li>Fixed another bug with RedHat 6.1. (I really have to find time to
talk to this guy)
</ul>
<h3>Overview of changes in Etherape 0.2.1 (Monday 03-06-2000):</h3><ul>
<li>Added tcp mode. Run with etherape -m tcp
<li>Added fix from Ted Wright to provide a more readable display
in crowded diagrams. Run with -o. Very useful for tcp.
<li>Cleaned up sources so that adding other modes should be trivial.
Please have a look at the source.
</ul>
<h3>Overview of changes in Etherape 0.2.0 (Friday 03-03-2000):</h3><ul>
<li>RedHat 6.1 fix. Works around "featureful" redhat 6.1 libpcap.
<li>Fixed node-in-the-center bug.
<li>Timeout=0 means never timeout.
</ul>
<h3>Overview of changes in Etherape 0.1.9 (Thursday 03-02-2000):</h3><ul>
<li>Finally I'm properly calculating average traffic. (yeah, right :-)
<li>Node and link timeout work as expected as well.
<li>Should now compile cleanly in Solaris.
<li>Interape is a hardlinked to etherape. Runs as interape when called
with that name.
<li>Minor changes to the naming algorithm.
</ul>
<h3>Overview of changes in Etherape 0.1.8 (Wednesday 03-01-2000):</h3><ul>
<li>First version of interape. Run as etherape -I. I guess I'll
have to change the name to netape now. :-)
<li>Added node and link timeouts controls.
</ul>
<h3>Overview of changes in Etherape 0.1.7 (Tuesday 02-29-2000):</h3><ul>
<li>Pcap filtering added. Now you can use tcpdump style filtering 
(enclosed in quotes) with the -f option.
<li>Added libm to autoconf.in for systems with a separate math lib.
<li>First try at Debian packaging.
</ul>
<h3>Overview of changes in Etherape 0.1.6 (Monday 02-28-2000):</h3><ul>
<li>Refresh period spin, averaging time spin, and link width sliders
    now work. Time to get better than Quake frame rates! :-)
<li>Node, link and text colours can be set from the command line.
<li>The rest of the GUI is active, so that it can answer itself
    people's favourite question. :-) (Well, Control-Q does actually work!)
<li>Automated release process so that I can keep bombarding
    you with releases.
</ul>
<h3>Overview of changes in Etherape 0.1.5 (Sunday 02-27-2000):</h3><ul>
<li> More for readability: Click on a node and a pop-up window
  appears with all node data.
<li> You can change the network interface to listen to in the 
  command line.
<li> Fixed a bug in the dotted quad ip number display
<li> Compiles without warnings
<li> Updated README

</ul><h3>Overview of changes in Etherape 0.1.4 (Sunday 02-27-2000):</h3><ul>
<li> Now parses command line arguments:
  <br>etherape options
  <br>-n, --numeric               don't convert addresses to names
  <br>-r, --with-dns-resolving    use IP name resolving. Caution! Long timeouts!
  <br>-d, --diagram-only          don't display any node text identification
<li> The resolver is turned off by default since it can potentially
  freeze your display for too long
<li> digram-only makes for a clearer display. It's intended to be
  practical whenever I have per-node pop-up windows ready.

</ul><h3>Overview of changes in Etherape 0.1.3 (Saturday 02-26-2000):</h3><ul>
<li> Links with no traffic disappear with time. Makes diagram
  more readable.
<li> IP host name displayed if no ether name available
<li> Oops! Was confusing ether dst and src addresses. Solved.
<li> Web page now has a much more interesting screenshot thanks 
  to Nico Lumma 
<li> Buttons are in English now.
<li>(This file I had to get out from download because it
had the dangerous DNS behaviour by default. You see? That's
what happens when you are rushed by deadlines! :-) )

</ul><h3>Overview of changes in Etherape 0.1.2 (Saturday 02-26-2000):</h3><ul>
<li> James Wallace provided code to automatically
  detect proper network interface. It now compiles in NetBSD.
<li> IP number displayed if no /etc/ethers is available.
  IP host name will be there in the Saturday Night edition. :-)

</ul><h3>Overview of changes in Etherape 0.1.1 (Friday 02-25-2000):</h3><ul>
<li> First look at GUI side of things
<li> Now you can dynamically reset the node radius using a slider
<li> First users reports! Thanks R., Don!
<li> First improvements due to user feedback:
   <ul>
   <li>Solved configuration problem for some people
   <li>Improved web page and README: reference to /etc/ethers
   </ul>

</ul><h3>Overview of changes in Etherape 0.1.0 (Friday 02-25-2000):</h3><ul>
<li> Diagram resizes with window
<li> Basic functionality is all there now, and calls for a minor
  version upgrade. :-)
  
</ul><h3>Overview of changes in Etherape 0.0.8 (Thursday 02-24-2000):</h3><ul>
<li> Correctly (I hope) calculates average traffic intensity
  for nodes and links. The proper constant multiplier
  should be user defined.

</ul><h3>Overview of changes in Etherape 0.0.7 (Thursday 02-24-2000):</h3><ul>
<li> First version showing links among nodes
<li> Aborts gracefully if run by non-root.
<li> http://etherape.sourceforge.net has a screenshot.
<li> Expect proper node size and link width calculation in 0.0.8

</ul><h3>Overview of changes in Etherape 0.0.6 (Wednesday 02-23-2000):</h3><ul>
<li> Copied proper libpcap autoconfigure detection function from ethereal
<li> Added Ethernet address resolution functions from ethereal

</ul><h3>Overview of changes in Etherape 0.0.5 (Wednesday 02-23-2000):</h3><ul>
<li> Now uses gnome_canvas to display the diagram

</ul><h3>Overview of changes in Etherape 0.0.4 (Monday 02-21-2000):</h3><ul>
<li> Node size is now an average of the last ten seconds traffic.
<li> Proper distribution file.

</ul><h3>Overview of changes in Etherape 0.0.3 (Sunday 02-20-2000):</h3><ul>
<li> Added gnome support.
<li> Substituted hash table for binary tree to store nodes
<li> Correctly display hardware addresses.

</ul><h3>Overview of changes in Etherape 0.0.2 (Saturday 02-19-2000):</h3><ul>
<li> Displays circles representing nodes and text which will
  identify it eventually.
  
</ul><h3>Overview of Etherape 0.0.1 (Friday 02-18-2000):</h3><ul>
<li> Initial version. Don't even expect it to run.
