    <h3>Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.6.6 (Saturday
    04-21-2001):</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Fixes a serious leak introduced in 0.6.1</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.6.5 (Saturday
    04-21-2001):</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Reports less false positive by giving priority to
      registered port numbers (below 1024) and fixing a bug that
      was causing etherape to only acknowledge RCP_REPLY
      messages</li>

      <li>Get extensive node info in console by double clicking it
      (use export DEBUG=INFO)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.6.4 (Friday
    04-20-2001):</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Better support for NetBIOS over IP name recognition
      (captures names from host announcements messages, besides the
      already supported session_request)</li>

      <li>Fixes the "Illegal" node name bug</li>

      <li>Compile fixes for platforms breaking at the libpcap
      check</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.6.3 (Thursday
    04-19-2001):</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Can find windows names in netbios over TCP session
      packets</li>

      <li>Fixed a couple of cases in which ethernet addresses were
      displayed instead of IP addresses</li>

      <li>Should report less false positive protocol
      identifications</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.6.2 (Wednesday
    04-18-2001):</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>New interface setting menu: now you can set the device to
      capture from at run time</li>

      <li>Added support for RPC protocols. That means that NFS
      shows as such most of the time at last</li>

      <li>Fixed a bug introduced in 0.6.0 that froze EtherApe</li>

      <li>Fixed a couple of references to null pointers which I
      believe where the cause of most crashes</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.6.1 (Tuesday
    04-17-2001):</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>New mode setting menu: now you can choose among link
      layer, IP or TCP modes on the fly from whitin the GUI</li>

      <li>The status bar now shows an actually informative
      message</li>
    </ul>

    04-15-2001):</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Play, pause and stop buttons now work as expected</li>

      <li>New open capture file menu item</li>

      <li>Fixed filter history</li>

      <li>Fixed ip addresses not showing in FDDI</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.5.9 (Thursday
    04-12-2001):</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Does not leak anymore. Formally tested! :-)</li>

      <li>Online documentation. At least you get the menu entries.
      I still need to finnish writing the docs :-)</li>

      <li>Default operation mode is now IP. If you want to go back
      to ethernet mode, use <tt>-m ethernet</tt> at the command
      line</li>

      <li>Loopback device now supported (was needed to test
      non-leakage)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.5.8 (Thursday
    04-05-2001):</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Fixed non-displaying text on diagram. If you still see
      squares instead of text, go to preferences and choose a new
      font. Save your preferences.</li>

      <li>Application icon now shows on the window manager and the
      about box</li>

      <li>Rpm package does not require alsa anymore</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.5.7 (Tuesday
    04-03-2001):</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Dutch translation. (Thanks, Vincent)</li>

      <li>Fixed compilation problem with resolver library and newer
      libc</li>

      <li>Menu entries for Gnome and Debian systems</li>

      <li>Included application icon. I can't track who sent me the
      couple of icons I have. If anybody knows who the author is,
      please tell me so that I can properly credit him</li>

      <li>New version after eleven months! Development is retaken!
      :-)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.5.6 (Thursday
    05-4-2000):</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Fixed a stupid but serious bug introduced in 0.5.3 which
      caused the capture to stop for no good reason. This happened
      because I was away from home and I was developing using only
      capture files with no access to any live network. I'm sorry
      it took me this long to solve the problem... :-(</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.5.5 (Saturday
    04-22-2000):</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>New Stack Level setting: "Topmost Recognized Protocol".
      This is probably what you want to have as default. If you
      have used any previous version of EtherApe and have saved
      your settings, you will probably want to change it.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.5.4 (Saturday
    04-22-2000):</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>TCP and UDP protocols are read from a configuration file:
      services. I could use some help in trying to determine what's
      missing and what should not be in in the deafault services
      file. Unified diffs accepted. :-)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.5.3 (Friday
    04-21-2000):</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Added start and stop buttons. The toolbar is back, since
      it is now useful. :-)</li>

      <li>General menu cleanup</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.5.2 (Thursday
    04-20-2000):</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Added new -l option. You can use it to limit the nodes
      displayed only to the N most active. GUI configuration and
      more the ability to use more criteria will come next</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.5.1 (Wednesday
    04-19-2000):</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Fixed lots of memory leaks thanks to Owen Taylor and his
      fantastic memprof</li>

      <li>Should not hog the CPU in offline mode anymore</li>

      <li>Node size is zero again when the average traffic is
      zero</li>

      <li>Got rid of the toolbar by default</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.5.0 (Saturday
    04-15-2000):</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Fixed PPP and SLIP modes not showing any protocols nor
      names</li>

      <li>
        Moved code to libglade. This means: 

        <ul>
          <li>You will need libglade to compile and run
          EtherApe</li>

          <li>No more GTK warnings</li>

          <li>The view menu is fixed. Check buttons work as
          expected</li>

          <li>You can change the interface by editing
          EtherApe.glade with glade without having to
          recompile</li>

          <li>All kinds of benefits for the developer. Now I can go
          back at dealing with the GUI</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>These are major changes. Please report any problems (see
      README.bugs)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.4.7 (Friday
    04-14-2000):</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Fixed segfault when applying preferences changes and a
      filter had been set up in the command line</li>

      <li>(Bill Barth) New, improved static mode</li>

      <li>Debug messages depend on the DEBUG environment variable.
      You can set it to DEBUG or INFO if you want to see them
      again. Added -q option too, to get rid of WARNINGS as
      well</li>

      <li>Refresh period is finally working the intended way (I
      hope). Should free up CPU in many cases</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.4.6 (Monday
    04-10-2000):</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Ports were not appearing in TCP mode</li>

      <li>Accumulated per name traffic was not properly
      updated</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.4.5 (Sunday
    04-09-2000):</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>/etc/ethers is used again in Ethernet mode</li>

      <li>FQDN is again only used in IP or TCP mode</li>

      <li>Added new --stationary option, so that people getting
      sick of following nodes around can have a rest. :-)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.4.4 (Sunday
    04-09-2000):</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Nodes keep track of all names by which they are
      referenced. Right now only the most used one is
      displayed</li>

      <li>This breaks /etc/ethers usage for IP nodes. You'll see
      your router change names a lot in ethernet mode. :-) I'll try
      to solve this tonight.</li>

      <li>I changed quite a lot of things. Please test it and tell
      me any problems you find so that I can fix them</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.4.3 (Tuesday
    04-04-2000):</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Recognizes IP fragmentation. Should make up for
      unexpected protocols in your network</li>

      <li>Node colors are those of its most common protocol. This
      is a bonus on my way of handling several names per node.</li>

      <li>Fixed a bug by which actually the <b>least</b> common
      protocol had its color shown. Come on, guys... How come
      nobody reported this one? :-)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.4.2 (Tuesday
    04-04-2000):</h3>

      <li>Hiding legend works again (for me, at least).</li>

      <li>Link directions were reversed in ethernet mode.</li>

      <li>New webpage (mostly copied from ethereal's :-) )</li>

      <li>First try at RPM distribution. Please report whether it
      works.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.4.0 (Wednesday
    03-29-2000):</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Node size is dependent on outbound traffic</li>

      CPU can't handle it, it will just do a best effort.</li>

      <li>Patch from Fabrice Bellet. Should fix more RedHat
      problems. Please report if it solves yours.</li>

      <li>Some more segfault fixing.</li>

      <li>Prefs window is raised when called.</li>

      <li>I think I fixed almost all memory leaks.</li>

      <li>Some more segfaults fixed.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.3.7 (Friday
    03-24-2000):</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>You can now "playback" tcpdump output files.</li>

      <li>The legend now has a scrollbar if there are more
      protocols than it can hold.</li>

    <h3>Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.3.6 (Friday
    03-24-2000):</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Recognizes level 5 UDP protocols.</li>

      <li>Default stack level is now 5</li>

      <li>Can anybody please send me the most complete
      /etc/services in Earth? Mine in debian is quite complete, but
      it's missing things like ICQ.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.3.5 (Thursday
    03-23-2000):</h3>

    </ul>

    <h3>Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.3.2 (Wednesday
    03-22-2000):</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>You may choose what level of the protocol stack to look
      at. Now I should be able to add more protocol decoding
      easyly.</li>

      <li>I think I have squashed the growing legend bug. Please
      report.</li>

      <li>Diagram tries to use most of the window.</li>

      you with releases.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.1.5 (Sunday
    02-27-2000):</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>More for readability: Click on a node and a pop-up window
      appears with all node data.</li>

      <li>You can change the network interface to listen to in the
      command line.</li>

      <li>Fixed a bug in the dotted quad ip number display</li>

      <li>Compiles without warnings</li>

      <li>Updated README</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.1.4 (Sunday
    02-27-2000):</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Now parses command line arguments:<br>
       etherape options<br>
       -n, --numeric don't convert addresses to names<br>
       -r, --with-dns-resolving use IP name resolving. Caution!
      Long timeouts!<br>
       -d, --diagram-only don't display any node text
      identification</li>

      <li>The resolver is turned off by default since it can
      potentially freeze your display for too long</li>

      <li>digram-only makes for a clearer display. It's intended to
      be practical whenever I have per-node pop-up windows
      ready.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Overview of changes in EtherApe 0.1.3 (Saturday
    02-26-2000):</h3>

    <ul>

      more readable.</li>

      <li>IP host name displayed if no ether name available</li>

      <li>Oops! Was confusing ether dst and src addresses.
      Solved.</li>

      <li>Web page now has a much more interesting screenshot
      thanks to Nico Lumma</li>

      <li>Buttons are in English now.</li>

      <li>(This file I had to get out from download because it had
      the dangerous DNS behaviour by default. You see? That's what
      happens when you are rushed by deadlines! :-) )</li>
    </ul>

    02-26-2000):</h3>

      <li>James Wallace provided code to automatically detect
      proper network interface. It now compiles in NetBSD.</li>

      host name will be there in the Saturday Night edition.
      :-)</li>

    02-24-2000):</h3>
