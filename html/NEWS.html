  <li>New version after eleven
months! Development is retaken! :-)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Overview of changes in
EtherApe 0.5.6 (Thursday 05-4-2000):</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed a stupid but serious
bug introduced in 0.5.3 which caused the capture to stop for no good
reason. This happened because I was away from home and I was developing
using only capture files with no access to any live network. I'm sorry
it took me this long to solve the problem... :-(</li>
</ul>
<h3>Overview of changes in
EtherApe 0.5.5 (Saturday 04-22-2000):</h3>
<ul>
  <li>New Stack Level setting:
"Topmost Recognized Protocol". This is probably what you want to have
as default. If you have used any previous version of EtherApe and have
saved your settings, you will probably want to change it.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Overview of changes in
EtherApe 0.5.4 (Saturday 04-22-2000):</h3>
<ul>
  <li>TCP and UDP protocols are
read from a configuration file: services. I could use some help in
trying to determine what's missing and what should not be in in the
deafault services file. Unified diffs accepted. :-)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Overview of changes in
EtherApe 0.5.3 (Friday 04-21-2000):</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Added start and stop
buttons. The toolbar is back, since it is now useful. :-)</li>
  <li>General menu cleanup</li>
</ul>
<h3>Overview of changes in
EtherApe 0.5.2 (Thursday 04-20-2000):</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Added new -l option. You can
use it to limit the nodes displayed only to the N most active. GUI
configuration and more the ability to use more criteria will come next</li>
</ul>
<h3>Overview of changes in
EtherApe 0.5.1 (Wednesday 04-19-2000):</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed lots of memory leaks
thanks to Owen Taylor and his fantastic memprof</li>
  <li>Should not hog the CPU in
offline mode anymore</li>
  <li>Node size is zero again when
the average traffic is zero</li>
  <li>Got rid of the toolbar by
default</li>
</ul>
<h3>Overview of changes in
EtherApe 0.5.0 (Saturday 04-15-2000):</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed PPP and SLIP modes not
showing any protocols nor names</li>
  <li> Moved code to libglade.
This means:
    <ul>
      <li>You will need libglade
to compile and run EtherApe</li>
      <li>No more GTK warnings</li>
      <li>The view menu is fixed.
Check buttons work as expected</li>
      <li>You can change the
interface by editing EtherApe.glade with glade without having to
recompile</li>
      <li>All kinds of benefits
for the developer. Now I can go back at dealing with the GUI</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>These are major changes.
Please report any problems (see README.bugs)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Overview of changes in
EtherApe 0.4.7 (Friday 04-14-2000):</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed segfault when applying
preferences changes and a filter had been set up in the command line</li>
  <li>(Bill Barth) New, improved
static mode</li>
  <li>Debug messages depend on the
DEBUG environment variable. You can set it to DEBUG or INFO if you want
to see them again. Added -q option too, to get rid of WARNINGS as well</li>
  <li>Refresh period is finally
working the intended way (I hope). Should free up CPU in many cases</li>
</ul>
<h3>Overview of changes in
EtherApe 0.4.6 (Monday 04-10-2000):</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Ports were not appearing in
TCP mode</li>
  <li>Accumulated per name traffic
was not properly updated</li>
</ul>

option, so that people getting sick of following nodes around can have
a rest. :-)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Overview of changes in
EtherApe 0.4.4 (Sunday 04-09-2000):</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Nodes keep track of all
names by which they are referenced. Right now only the most used one is
displayed</li>
  <li>This breaks /etc/ethers
usage for IP nodes. You'll see your router change names a lot in
ethernet mode. :-) I'll try to solve this tonight.</li>
  <li>I changed quite a lot of
things. Please test it and tell me any problems you find so that I can
fix them</li>
</ul>

<ul>

  <li>Node colors are those of its
most common protocol. This is a bonus on my way of handling several
names per node.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug by which
actually the <b>least</b>
common protocol had its color shown. Come on, guys... How come nobody
reported this one? :-)</li>

<ul>
  <li>Recognizes level 5 UDP
protocols.</li>
  <li>Default stack level is now 5</li>
  <li>Can anybody please send me
the most complete /etc/services in Earth? Mine in debian is quite
complete, but it's missing things like ICQ.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Overview of changes in
EtherApe 0.3.5 (Thursday 03-23-2000):</h3>

  <li>Added fix from Ted Wright to
provide a more readable display in crowded diagrams. Run with -o. Very
useful for tcp.</li>
  <li>Cleaned up sources so that
adding other modes should be trivial. Please have a look at the source.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Overview of changes in
EtherApe 0.2.0 (Friday 03-03-2000):</h3>
<ul>
  <li>RedHat 6.1 fix. Works around
"featureful" redhat 6.1 libpcap.</li>
  <li>Fixed node-in-the-center bug.</li>
  <li>Timeout=0 means never
timeout.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Overview of changes in
EtherApe 0.1.9 (Thursday 03-02-2000):</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Finally I'm properly
calculating average traffic. (yeah, right :-)</li>
  <li>Node and link timeout work
as expected as well.</li>
  <li>Should now compile cleanly
in Solaris.</li>
  <li>Interape is a hardlinked to
etherape. Runs as interape when called with that name.</li>
  <li>Minor changes to the naming
algorithm.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Overview of changes in
EtherApe 0.1.8 (Wednesday 03-01-2000):</h3>
<ul>
  <li>First version of interape.
Run as EtherApe -I. I guess I'll have to change the name to netape now.
:-)</li>
  <li>Added node and link timeouts
controls.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Overview of changes in
EtherApe 0.1.7 (Tuesday 02-29-2000):</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Pcap filtering added. Now
you can use tcpdump style filtering (enclosed in quotes) with the -f
option.</li>
  <li>Added libm to autoconf.in
for systems with a separate math lib.</li>
  <li>First try at Debian
packaging.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Overview of changes in
EtherApe 0.1.6 (Monday 02-28-2000):</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Refresh period spin,
averaging time spin, and link width sliders now work. Time to get
better than Quake frame rates! :-)</li>
  <li>Node, link and text colours
can be set from the command line.</li>
  <li>The rest of the GUI is
active, so that it can answer itself people's favourite question. :-)
(Well, Control-Q does actually work!)</li>
  <li>Automated release process so
that I can keep bombarding you with releases.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Overview of changes in
EtherApe 0.1.5 (Sunday 02-27-2000):</h3>
<ul>
  <li>More for readability: Click
on a node and a pop-up window appears with all node data.</li>
  <li>You can change the network
interface to listen to in the command line.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug in the dotted
quad ip number display</li>
  <li>Compiles without warnings</li>
  <li>Updated README</li>
</ul>
<h3>Overview of changes in
EtherApe 0.1.4 (Sunday 02-27-2000):</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Now parses command line
arguments:<br>
etherape options<br>
-n, --numeric don't convert addresses to names<br>
-r, --with-dns-resolving use IP name resolving. Caution! Long timeouts!<br>
-d, --diagram-only don't display any node text identification</li>
  <li>The resolver is turned off
by default since it can potentially freeze your display for too long</li>
  <li>digram-only makes for a
clearer display. It's intended to be practical whenever I have per-node
pop-up windows ready.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Overview of changes in

<ul>
  <li>Links with no traffic
disappear with time. Makes diagram more readable.</li>

ether name available</li>
  <li>Oops! Was confusing ether
dst and src addresses. Solved.</li>
  <li>Web page now has a much more
interesting screenshot thanks to Nico Lumma</li>
  <li>Buttons are in English now.</li>
  <li>(This file I had to get out
from download because it had the dangerous DNS behaviour by default.
You see? That's what happens when you are rushed by deadlines! :-) )</li>
</ul>
<h3>Overview of changes in
EtherApe 0.1.2 (Saturday 02-26-2000):</h3>
<ul>
  <li>James Wallace provided code

/etc/ethers is available. IP host name will be there in the Saturday
Night edition. :-)</li>
